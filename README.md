# CannedBeanMod
This simple mod adds cans of beans that can be looted in various chests across your Minecraft world. These cans be thrown by players as a damaging projectile, and upon hitting a surface they will pop open, allowing their contents to be eaten. This is an experimental mod created to test modding with Forge, so further regular updates should not be expected.
